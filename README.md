# Python Practice!

The functions here are my personal solutions to practice problems posted on the practicepython.org website, with a few exceptions being written during a 2-day workshop with the Tech Academy here in PDX. I enjoy tackling these little puzzles during my lunch breaks at work.

Writing these pieces has helped me to familiarize myself with Python syntax, but also with algorithmic thinking more generally as I begin to delve into object-oriented languages.
